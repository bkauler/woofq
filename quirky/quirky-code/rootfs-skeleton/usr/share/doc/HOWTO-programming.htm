Puppy Linux is a tiny distribution, but there is a wide choice of
programming languages. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The default live-CD is not setup for compiling programs, however there is an add-on 'devx' file that turns
Puppy into a complete compiling environment. The add-on file also provides Python. Without the add-on, Puppy already has
Ash/Bash and Perl scripting languages. This page has a summary of
the programming options in Puppy...<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Ash/Bash scripts</h2>


      <p>A language that is all ready for action in Puppy is <i>command-shell
scripting</i>. Unix and Linux shell command-scripting has been around for
ages and is going to be around for a long time to come. What I mean by the
"command shell" is the user interface that you use when at the commandline.
When you are running X, the commandline will be in a  terminal window, but
you can also exit from X and be back at a commandline.<br>
      </p>

The actual program that is running and doing the interacting with you is
known as the command-shell, and for Linux it is usually what is known as the
      <i>Bash</i> shell. In Puppy, you have a choice of two shells, Bash or <span style="font-style: italic;">Ash</span>.<br>

Note that when a terminal window is opened in X, Bash is running. If
you exit from X to the commandline, Ash is running. You can explicitly
choose either Bash or Ash in a script by placing "#!/bin/bash" or
"#!/bin/sh" (or "#!/bin/ash") on the first line.<br>

      <br>

A shell script is an executable program, except that it is a text file and
does not have to be compiled. Shell scripts can be very sophisticated, and
there are lots of them in Puppy.<br>

      <br>

This page is not a tutorial on how to program with Ash/Bash scripts --there
are  plenty of books on the subject and also on the Internet. There are a
couple  of Bash scripting HOWTOs to be found here:<br>

      <br>

"Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide": <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html">http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html</a>
      <br>

"Bash Programming - Introduction HOWTO": <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html</a>
      <br>

      <br>

To write a Ash/Bash script, all you need is a text editor, and Puppy has two
console editors, <i>e3</i> and <i>MP</i>, and two GUI editors, <i>Geany</i>
and <i>NicoEdit</i>. Geany, NicoEdit and MP have
color syntax highlighting for Bash/Ash scripts.<br>

      <br>

Have fun, write a script for Puppy!  <br>

      <br>
Here is an overview of tools to aid with scripting, with links to online docs:<br>

      </td>
      <td valign="top">This is yet another alternative to xmessage
        and Xdialog. Gtkdialog is a GTK2 application and reads an XML file
        that describes the dialog format and user interaction, allowing
        incredible sophisticated GUIs. I think that gtkdialog is the pick of the bunch!<br>
Note that Puppy currently has two versions of gtkdialog, named
gtkdialog2 and gtkdialog3 -- it is preferred that you use the latter as
this will eventually be the only one in Puppy -- in other words, always
execute the binary "gtkdialog3".<br>
Note, the <a href="gtkdialog3/gtkdialog.txt">user manual</a> for gtkdialog3 is rudimentary, but the 'devx'
module has many example programs at /usr/share/doc/gtkdialog3/examples in Puppy.<br>
Forum member 'zigbert' has a nice tutorial with tips on how to use gtkdialog: <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=38608">GtkDialog tips</a>.<br>

      <h2><span class="postbody">C/C++ programming</span></h2>

      <h3><span class="postbody"></span></h3>

      <span class="postbody">All of the tools for compiling C/C++ applications are to be found in an add-on file named <span style="font-style: italic;">*devx*.sfs</span> (* denotes optional extra text used to describe release version ec.). This is what we call an <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">SFS</span> file, and you can read an overview of these online in this page: <a href="http://puppylinux.com/development/package-management.htm">http://puppylinux.com/development/package-management.htm</a> <br>
<br>
To use this file is very simple. Download it from the Internet (it is
about 90MB) and save to /mnt/home (the same place as the "pupsave.2fs" file, that is, your saved session).
<br>
<br></span>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="postbody">
Or, if you have installed Puppy to hard drive with what we call a
"full" installation (Puppy occupying his own partition, no
ramdisk), then download the *devx*.sfs file ...then some manual steps are required, see here: <a href="http://www.puppylinux.com/hard-puppy.htm">http://www.puppylinux.com/hard-puppy.htm</a>.</span><br>
<span class="postbody"></span></div>

      <span class="postbody">
<br>
After downloading *devx*.sfs and placing it in the right place, reboot Puppy, and that's it, you're ready to go.<br>
All of the normal compiling tools work, such as "configure" and "make".<br>
<br>
Note, it is necessary that the PC have either a Linux swap partition and/or a <span style="font-style: italic;">lot</span>
of RAM. C/C++ compiling needs a lot of temporary space.<br>
<br>
It is also recommended that you place the source package (that you want to compile) in a mounted
Linux partition, not in /root. This is in the case of running from a
live-CD or a frugal install, in which '/' is actually a layered
filesystem. A layered filesystem sometimes causes problems with
compiling, so it is recommended to mount a hard drive partition for the
purpose -- a Linux partition, <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> a DOS/Windows partition!<br>
<br>
If you compile a package and would like to make it available for others
to use, it is very easy to create a PET package -- read this: <a href="http://www.puppylinux.com/development/createpet.htm">http://www.puppylinux.com/development/createpet.htm </a><br>
<br>
If you want to write GTK applications, the 'devx' file also has
'glade-3'. This is a visual GUI-builder. Find out more about Glade
here: <a href="http://glade.gnome.org/">http://glade.gnome.org/</a>
The 'glade-3' program generates an XML file, and Puppy has 'libglade',
a library that an application uses to read the XML file and generate
the GUI.<br>
<br>
Note, gtkdialog3 is also able to load a Glade XML file. See the
gtkdialog3 examples at /usr/share/doc/gtkdialog/examples, provided by
the 'devx' file. So, even a Bash script can utilise Glade.<br>
      </span>
      <h2><span class="postbody">Vala/Genie programming</span></h2>

      <h3><span class="postbody"></span></h3>

      <span class="postbody">This is the future. Vala and Genie are languages
in every respect superior to C/C++. Vala has a C#-like syntax, Genie
has a Python-like syntax. It is actually the same compiler, it just
accepts two alternative syntaxes.<br>
<br>
Vala/Genie is a true compiler environment and generates extremely
efficient executables. They are particularly nice for writing GTK
applications. I have placed the Vala/Genie compiler, with documentation
and the ValaIDE, in the 'devx' SFS file.<br>
<br>
Online documentation on Vala/Genie is here:<br>
<a href="http://bkhome.org/genie/index.html">http://bkhome.org/genie/index.html</a> <br>
<br>
The ValaIDE is an Integrated Development Environment, with a text
editor that has colour syntax highlghting for both Vala and Genie. If
the 'devx' SFS file is loaded, you will find an entry for ValaIDE in
the 'Utility' menu.<br>
<br>
Note that the NicoEdit text editor also has syntax highlighting for
Vala and Genie. The Geany text editor has syntax highlighting for Vala
but not Genie.<br>
<br>
Also if the 'devx' sfs file is loaded you will find the Vala Reference Manual at <a href="file:///usr/share/devhelp/books/vala/index.html">/usr/share/devhelp/books/vala/index.html</a>.<br>
<br>
You can find
some exciting new applications on the Puppy forum, that are gradually
finding their way into the official Puppy live-CD.<br>
<br>Nicholas's NicoEdit text editor is one example, a GTK application
written in
Genie. It doesn't stop there, Mark has written PuppyBrowser,
EmbeddedBookmarks and Pictureviewer in Genie</span>.<br>
      <h2>BaCon programming</h2>
BaCon is a structured-BASIC compiler ....what! ...why are we promoting
a 1970's programming language? Sometimes older and simpler is actually better. <br>
      <br>
BaCon is very easy to learn and get productive in a very short time. It
is also one of the easiest ways to write GTK GUI applications, using
HUG (Highlevel Universal GUI).<br>
      <br>
The main reason that you would write a program in a compilable language
is due to very much faster execution speed compared with a shell
script. It also gives you ready access to all the shared libraries,
which you can't really call from a script.<br>
<br>
I have created an introductory page, with links to everything you need to know:<br>
      <a href="http://bkhome.org/bacon/">http://bkhome.org/bacon/</a> <br>
      <br>
The author of BaCon is Peter van Eerten, and this is his project home:<br>
      <a href="http://www.basic-converter.org/">http://www.basic-converter.org/</a> <br>
      <br>
When you have the 'devx' SFS file loaded, you will find documentation and .bac include files in /usr/share/BaCon.<br>

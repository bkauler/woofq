<h1>InkLite</h1>
<br>
Light version of Inkscape vector graphics editor, especially for Puppy.<br>
<br>
InkLite is based upon Inkscape v0.36, the last release of Inkscape that
was written in C (not C++) and did not use the GTKMM library. InkLite
is about 1/5 the size of the latest Inkscape.<br>
<br>
Inkscape was originally a fork from the Sodipodi project, and the
documentation for Sodipodi is the closest to the features offered in
InkLite.<br>

#easyos, desk0 is a container, see /mnt/wkg/containers/desk0, launched at
#bootup see /root/Startup/zephyr -- this script launches Xephyr X server, and
#the desk0 container. apps in desk0 will run DISPLAY :1, which is the Xephyr window.
#ec-chroot, the script that starts the container, copies /etc/resolv.conf into the
#container, however, network connection is not established that early in bootup, and
#that file is empty.
#/etc/eventmanager specifies the dependency for this script, /etc/init.d/petget0,
#as 'network', so the pup_event service manager will call this script when the network
#goes up, or down.
#180726 /root/Startup/zephyr removed, now, desk0 started when click on "desk" desktop icon. but still need this script.
#191218 the desktop containers are called "pyro", "buster", so write to all of them. script renamed from "desk0" to "ec-net".

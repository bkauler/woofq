#180407 need this script for the "www" desktop icon. WOOFQONLYMARKER
#20211107 firefox pet 'pinstall.sh' changes "seamonkey" to "firefox" in this file.

#note: the container is name "www", ec-chroot will run /ec-run inside the
# container, which will look for an executable named "www", failing that it will
# run the next parameter, which is "seamonkey".
#exec ec-chroot www seamonkey
#181014 this was working, now not starting, have to launch via urxvt...
#urxvt -name eclaunch -iconic -e ec-chroot www seamonkey
#181017 simpler solution:
empty -f ec-chroot www seamonkey

EasyOS does not use apt, aptitude, nor any package that manages debian packages.
The exception is the simple dpkg utility.

/usr/local/neo-apt is intended to have scripts that replace the debian apt CLI utility and associated utilities.
/usr/bin/apt and /usr/bin/apt-get are symlinks to /usr/local/neo-apt/apt
